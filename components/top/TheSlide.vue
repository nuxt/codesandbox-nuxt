        <h4>SPONSORS</h4>
        <p>
          NuxtJS is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use.
          However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and
          develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper
          financial backing. If you run a business and are using Nuxt
          in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor
          Nuxt development: it ensures the project that your product relies
          on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your
          exposure in the Vue/Nuxt community and makes it easier to attract
          Vue/Nuxt developers. If you are an individual user and have enjoyed
          the productivity of using Nuxt, consider donating
          as a sign of appreciation.
